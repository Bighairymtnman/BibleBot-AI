## About The Project

BibleBot AI is a friendly and intelligent chatbot that makes exploring the Bible intuitive and accessible. Whether you're looking for a specific verse, seeking encouragement for a particular emotion, or just want a random piece of scripture to reflect on, BibleBot is here to help.

This project was built as a modern Progressive Web App, which means it's fast, reliable, and can be "installed" directly to your phone or computer's home screen for an app-like experience, even working offline.

## Features

*   ** Conversational Interface:** Chat with the bot using natural language.
*   ** Verse of the Day:** Get a curated verse to start your day.
*   ** Emotional Support:** Feeling sad, angry, or anxious? The bot can provide relevant, comforting scriptures.
*   ** Specific Verse Lookup:** Instantly retrieve any verse or passage by its reference (e.g., `John 3:16` or `Ecclesiastes 3:1-8`).
*   ** Random Verse:** Discover a new piece of scripture with the random verse feature.
*   ** PWA Functionality:** Installable on any device (iOS, Android, Desktop) for quick access and offline capabilities.
